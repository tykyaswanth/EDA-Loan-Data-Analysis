# EDA-Loan-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis on loan application dataset using visualization, statistical testing, and regression modelling.

# Exploratory Data Analysis – Loan Application Dataset

This project was completed as part of the Programming for Data Analytics module, accounting for 65% of the overall grade. It involves performing a full-scale exploratory data analysis on a loan application dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and statistical insights useful in a real-world business context.

## 🧮 Analysis Steps

1. Generated descriptive statistics and identified key trends
2. Handled missing values appropriately
3. Built visualisations to analyse:
   - Single continuous variable distributions
   - Relationships between continuous variables
   - Associations between categorical and continuous variables
   - Multivariable interactions using semantic mappings
4. Displayed unique values and frequencies of categorical variables
5. Created a contingency table and tested for independence between categorical variables
6. Extracted data subsets using multiple conditions
7. Conducted significance tests on mean differences between subsets
8. Grouped data by category and summarised with mean/sum values
9. Built a linear regression model and interpreted its output and accuracy
